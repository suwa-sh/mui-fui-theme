## Overview
Definitions and summaries of psychological effects, biases, and design principles that influence decision-making and are important for improving User Experience (UX).

## Principles List

* **Aesthetic-Usability Effect**
  The phenomenon where beautifully designed products are intuitively perceived as easier to use than those that are not.
* **Anchor Effect**
  A psychological phenomenon where the first piece of information presented (anchor) becomes a reference point that influences subsequent judgments and evaluations.
* **Banner Blindness**
  The phenomenon where users unconsciously ignore elements that resemble advertising banners on websites.
* **Cognitive Load**
  The amount of mental energy users consume to process and understand information.
* **Confirmation Bias**
  The tendency to preferentially accept information that aligns with one's beliefs or hypotheses while ignoring or denying contradicting information.
* **Curiosity Gap**
  A technique that leverages the desire to fill information gaps to arouse user interest and drive action.
* **Decision Fatigue**
  The phenomenon where mental energy is depleted through repeated decisions, making rational choices difficult.
* **Decoy Effect**
  A technique that makes a specific option appear more attractive by deliberately including a less appealing "decoy" option.
* **Default Bias**
  The tendency to continue selecting the initial setting (default) as long as there is no clear reason to change it.
* **Doherty Threshold**
  The threshold indicating that user interest loss risk increases when response time exceeds 0.4 seconds.
* **Empathy Gap**
  A state of disconnect where creators cannot sufficiently empathize with users' emotions, needs, and perspectives.
* **Endowment Effect**
  The tendency to value things one already owns more highly than things one does not possess.
* **Expectation Bias**
  The phenomenon where prior expectations and preconceptions influence actual experiences and evaluations.
* **Familiarity Bias**
  The tendency to feel affinity and preference for designs or features one has seen or experienced before.
* **Foot in the Door Effect**
  The phenomenon where getting someone to agree to a small request makes them more likely to accept a larger request afterward.
* **Framing**
  The phenomenon where judgments are influenced more by how information is presented (framework/expression) than by the content itself.
* **Gamification**
  A technique that incorporates game elements (rewards, competition, etc.) to increase motivation and encourage behavior.
* **Goal Gradient Effect**
  A psychological phenomenon where actions and efforts toward achievement accelerate as the goal approaches.
* **Halo Effect**
  The phenomenon where a prominent characteristic of a subject (such as a positive impression) skews the overall evaluation.
* **Hawthorne Effect**
  The tendency for behavior to change when people are aware they are being observed.
* **Intentional Friction**
  A design technique that deliberately introduces obstacles or delays to prevent errors or encourage deliberation.
* **Labor Illusion**
  The phenomenon where showing that processing takes effort or time makes users perceive higher value in the service.
* **Loss Aversion**
  The psychological tendency to prioritize avoiding losses over gaining benefits.
* **Nudge**
  An intervention designed like "a gentle elbow push" to encourage voluntary behavior change without coercion.
* **Peak-End Rule**
  The principle that experience evaluation is determined by "the moment of peak emotion" and "the end" rather than the overall average.
* **Priming**
  The effect where preceding stimuli (information) influence subsequent unconscious judgments and behaviors.
* **Progressive Disclosure**
  A technique that reduces cognitive load by displaying information or features gradually as needed rather than all at once.
* **Pygmalion Effect**
  Psychological behavioral change where receiving expectations from others leads to producing results that match those expectations.
* **Reactance**
  Psychological resistance that arises when people feel their freedom of choice has been taken away or restricted.
* **Reactive Onboarding**
  Operational guidance presented at appropriate timing based on users' actual behaviors and situations.
* **Scarcity**
  A psychological effect where limited quantities or time periods make people feel higher value and increased desire.
* **Selective Attention**
  The function of focusing attention only on information important to oneself while ignoring other information among many inputs.
* **Serial Position Effect**
  The phenomenon where items at the beginning (primacy effect) and end (recency effect) of a list are remembered better than those in the middle.
* **Skeuomorphism**
  A design approach that mimics real-world material textures and characteristics digitally to promote intuitive understanding.
* **Social Proof**
  A psychological phenomenon where people trust and conform to others' actions and evaluations (reviews, track records, etc.) more than their own judgment.
* **Sunk Cost Effect**
  The psychology of making irrational continuations or investments trying to recover costs (money/time) already spent.
* **Survey Bias**
  When results deviate from reality or become skewed due to survey design or response conditions.
* **Temptation Bundling**
  A technique that increases action execution rates by pairing "what you want to do (pleasure)" with "what you should do (effort)."
* **User Delight**
  Experiences that give users unexpected joy or surprise beyond functionality and convenience.
* **Variable Reward**
  A mechanism that fuels anticipation and maintains behavior by randomizing the timing and content of rewards.
* **Visual Anchor**
  A technique that places visually prominent elements to attract users' gaze and attention to specific locations.
* **Visual Hierarchy**
  A technique that visually organizes information importance and priority by adjusting size, color, and placement.
* **Zeigarnik Effect**
  The phenomenon where interrupted or incomplete tasks are remembered more strongly than completed tasks.
